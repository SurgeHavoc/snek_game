# snek_game

## Description

A game with origins dating back to the 70's "Snake" is a classic arcade game that's both simple and fun. And as such, snek_game is a modern take on this type of game and made in C++ using teh SDL2 library.
In snek_game, the player can control a "snake" that can move around in a box-like level while trying to gather the "apples" that spawn randomly on the screen.
The objective is to navigate the "snake" without colliding with any obstacles, walls, or the "snake" itself.
As the player progresses, the score will increase, and so will the speed of the game. This ramps up the difficulty, providing an escalating challenge.

### Motivation

Retro arcade games are some of my favorite games ever. Snake was an easy pick to make because it is simple, fun, and iconic. I also developed this project to enhance my understanding of using C++ with SDL2 and game architecture.
This project also happened to provide me with an opportunity to implement a cap on frame rate, leading me to eventually get into learning variable frame rate.
